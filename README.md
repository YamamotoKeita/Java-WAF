A Java Web Application Framework (WAF) created around 2007, which is not used now. 

As a WAF, it is similar to Spring MVC (but doesn't have DI container). It also includes various utilities such as db, http, ftp, io, etc. 

I created this going for my ideal WAF, but I stopped using this because I no longer felt motivated to continue to maintain my own WAF when there are other well-known and useful WAFs.
